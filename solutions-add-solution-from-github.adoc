Learn how to deploy a Solution from a GitHub repository.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in a GitHub repository.
* An SSH keypair for use as the deploy key. To learn how to generate an SSH keypair, we recommend https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key[this GitHub article].

== Add the Solution

The first step is to add the Solution to your NKS account.

=== Select Solution Type

Click **Projects** then select the Project you want to use.

Click **+ Add Solution**.

Click **Application** as the Solution type.

Select the Workspace, Cluster, and Project you want to use, then click **Next**.

=== Define Version Control

In this step you will define the version control specifics. You will need to provide two things:

* The Remote URL
* The Private Deploy Key

**Remote URL**

For a GitHub project, this is the project's SSH Clone URL. To get this URL, visit your project's GitHub repository page and click the green **Clone or download** button.

NOTE: You must use "Clone with SSH." If the pop-up says "Clone with HTTPS", click the "Use SSH" link in the upper right-hand corner of the pop-up to switch to SSH.

Click to copy the SSH URL. Paste this in to NKS as the Remote URL.

**Private Deploy Key**

For this step you will need an SSH keypair. To learn how to generate an SSH keypair, we recommend https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key[this GitHub article].

NOTE: Do not set a passphrase for the keypair.

* Give the **public** key to GitHub.
* Paste the **private** key into the Private Deploy Key field.

Click **Next** to continue.

=== Configure Application

Set the application's name, update strategy, and scaling. Click **Next** to continue.

=== Review and Confirm

Review and confirm all your settings. To change a setting, click the Edit button. When you are sure that everything is correct, click **Create** to create the Solution.

This creates your Solution and redirects you to the Application's page.

== Deploy and Update Code

Next, you will add configurations to your GitHub repository. To do this, you will give GitHub:

* The **public** key from the SSH keypair you used for the Deploy Key.
* The Payload URL.
* The Webhook Secret.

You will find the Payload URL and Webhook Secret on the application's page.

Go to the GitHub page for your repository and click **Settings**.

=== Add the Deploy Key

Click **Deploy keys** then click **Add deploy key**. Be sure to add the **public** (not private) SSH key. You do not need to enable write access.

=== Add the Webhook

Click **Webhooks** then click **Add webhook**.

Return to the NKS application page, where you will find the Payload URL and Webhook Secret.

image::solutions-add-github-solution-deploy-code.png[Deploy the code]

Paste these in to the Payload URL and Webhook Secret fields on GitHub. For **Content Type** select `application/json`.

image::solutions-add-github-solution-add-webhook.png[Add the webhook to GitHub]

Enable SSL verification, set the events you want to trigger the webhook, then click **Add webhook** to add it.

=== Trigger the Webhook if Necessary

When you add your webhook, GitHub gives you three choices for which events trigger the webhook:

* Just the `push` event
* Send me everything
* Let me select individual events

If your webhook is triggered by a `push` event, you will need to do a `git push` to trigger the webhook.

== Check Your Application

At this point everything is configured, although it make take a few minutes for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the process on the Solution's **Metrics** tab.

When the deployment is ready, you can view your application by visiting the ingress URL which NKS automatically created for your application.
