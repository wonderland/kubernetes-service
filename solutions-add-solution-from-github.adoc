:imagesdir: assets/documentation/solutions/

Learn how to deploy a NetApp Kubernetes Services (NKS) Solution from a https://github.com[GitHub] repository.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in a GitHub repository.
* An SSH keypair for use as the deploy key. To learn how to generate an SSH keypair, we recommend https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key[this GitHub article].

== Add the Solution

The first step is to add the Solution to your NKS account.

=== Select Solution Type

Click **Projects** then select the Project you want to use.

Click **+ Add Solution**. Click **Application** as the Solution type.

Select the Workspace, Cluster, and Project you want to use, then click **Next**.

=== Define Version Control

In this step you will set two items:

* NKS: The Remote URL
* GitHub: The Private Deploy Key

**Remote URL**

To get this URL, visit your project's GitHub repository page and click the green **Clone or download** button.

NOTE: You must use "Clone with SSH." If the pop-up says "Clone with HTTPS", click the "Use SSH" link in the upper right-hand corner of the pop-up to switch to SSH.

Click to copy the SSH URL. Paste this in to NKS as the Remote URL.

**Private Deploy Key**

For this step you will need an SSH keypair. To learn how to generate an SSH keypair, we recommend https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key[this GitHub article].

NOTE: Do not set a passphrase for the keypair.

* You will use the **public** key as the Deploy Key on GitHub in the next section.
* Paste the **private** key into the Private Deploy Key field on NKS.

Click **Next** to continue.

=== Configure Application

Set the application's name, update strategy, and scaling. Click **Next** to continue.

=== Review and Confirm

Review and confirm all your settings. To change a setting, click the Edit button.

When you are sure that everything is correct, click **Create** to create the Solution. This creates your Solution and redirects you to the Application's page.

== Deploy and Update Code

Next, you will add configurations to your GitHub repository. To do this, you will give GitHub:

* The Deploy Key. This is the **public** key you created.
* The Payload URL (webhook) from NKS.
* The Webhook Secret from NKS.

=== Add the Deploy Key

Go to the GitHub page for your repository and click **Settings**.

Click **Deploy keys** then click **Add deploy key**.

* Be sure to add the **public** (not private) SSH key.
* You do not need to enable write access.

=== Add the Webhook

From the GitHub **Settings** page, click **Webhooks** then click **Add webhook**.

Return to the NKS application page, where you will find the Payload URL and Webhook Secret.

Paste these in to the Payload URL and Webhook Secret fields on GitHub.

* For **Content Type** select `application/json`.
* Enable SSL verification.
* Set the events you want to trigger the webhook.

Click **Add webhook** to add the webhook.

=== Trigger the Webhook if Necessary

When you add your webhook, GitHub gives you three choices for which events trigger the webhook:

* Just the `push` event
* Send me everything
* Let me select individual events

If your webhook is triggered by a `push` event, you will need to do a `git push` to trigger the webhook.

== Check Your Application

At this point everything is configured, although it make take a few minutes for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the process on the Solution's **Metrics** tab.

When the deployment is ready, you can view your application by visiting the ingress URL which NKS automatically created for your application.
