= Members

You can add someone to your https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] account as either a Member or an Admin. link:/add-a-member.html[Click here for step-by-step instructions on adding a Member].

**Member:** By default, Member accounts have full access to Control Plane and Solutions functionality, including the ability to create and delete Kubernetes clusters. However, Members have restricted access to the Organization section.

Members can view:

* Teams
* Workspaces

Members cannot:

* Invite someone to an Organization.
* Add or remove users to Teams.
* Add or remove users to Workspaces.
* Access, view, or change anything on the Setup page.
* Access, view, or change anything on the Subscription page.

**Admin:* Admin accounts have full access to the entire NKS account, including the Setup and Subscription page.

NOTE: These privilege levels are the same for API access.

== Members and Organizations

Each Member must create their own NKS account. Each NKS account has its own (personal) Organization. To add someone to your NKS account, you will invite them to your Organization.

To switch Organizations, click the icon in the upper right-hand corner, then select the new Organization from the drop-down menu.
