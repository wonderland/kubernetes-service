NKS must be set up to manage a project within your Google Compute Engine (GCE) account. To do this, log into the Google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

Click **Project** to open the drop-down menu.

Locate the new `.json` file in your downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the contents into http://netapp.io[the NKS website] when you create a new cluster.
