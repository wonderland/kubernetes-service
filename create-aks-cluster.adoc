= Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Microsoft AKS

Learn how to create a Kubernetes cluster on AKS in three clicks, using https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)].

To create a Microsoft AKS cluster, you will need:

* A set of Azure credentials with AKS permissions. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-auth-credentials-on-azure.html[Find Your Azure Credentials].
* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

For more details, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/nks-requirements.html[our Requirements page].
