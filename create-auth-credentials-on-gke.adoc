= Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials

To create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need to either create a new GKE project and credentials, or get the Service Account JSON data from your existing GCE project.

To use this feature, you will need an NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

After you add your GKE credentials to your NKS account, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-gke-cluster.html[click here to learn how to create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE]

== Create a New Set of GKE Credentials

To create a new set of GKE credentials you will need to:

1. Create a new project.
2. Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
3. Create the credentials.

=== Create a New Project

NKS must be set up to manage a project within your Google Container Engine (GKE) account. To do this, log into the Google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

Click **Project** to open the drop-down menu.

In the pop-up window which appears, select an organization from the drop-down menu.

Click the **+** to Create Project.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-plus.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Create Project]

Fill in "NKS" as the project name, then click **Create**.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. After the task is complete, you will be redirected to the project Dashboard.

=== Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API

The next step is to use the API Manager to enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API for this project. Click **APIs & Services > Dashboard** in the navigation column on the left.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-api-manager.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: API Manager]

This will take you to the API Manager Dashboard. Click **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-enable-api.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Enable API]

This will take you to the API Library. Search for "Google Kubernetes Engine". From the search results, click **Kubernetes Engine API**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-kubernetes-engine-api.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Container Engine API]

This will take you to the Kubernetes Engine API page. Click **ENABLE** to enable the API.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/enable-kubernetes-engine-api.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click ENABLE]

=== Create Credentials

After the new project has been created, click the **Credentials** link on the left to create credentials.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/click-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Credentials]

In the pop-up window which appears, click **Create credentials**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/create-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Create Credentials]

From the drop-down menu, choose **Service account key**.

Click the **Service account** drop-down menu and choose **New service account**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/service-account-drop-down.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Service account key]

Fill out the following:

* In the **Service Account Name** field, give your account a name like `nks-admin`.
* For **Role** select **Project** > **Owner**.
* For **Key type** select **JSON**.

Then click **Create**.

The JSON credentials (keyset) will automatically be saved to your local computer.

Locate the new `.json` file in your downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the contents into https://nks.netapp.io[the NKS website] when you create a new cluster.


== Find Your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials

To create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need the Service Account JSON data.

You can only view or download the Service Account JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

=== Create a New GKE Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click **IAM & Admin**.

Click **Service Accounts**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gke/gke-auth-02-service-account.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine]

Click the Service Account for which you need to generate a new key.
