= Add a Solution from Bitbucket
:imagesdir: assets/documentation/solutions/

Learn how to deploy a NetApp Kubernetes Services (NKS) Solution from a https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket] repository.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in a Bitbucket repository.
* An SSH key pair for use as the deploy key. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For instructions on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[follow the instructions in this article].

== Add the Solution

The first step is to add the Solution to your NKS account.

=== Select Solution Type

Click **Projects** then select the Project you want to use.

Click **+ Add Solution**. Click **Application** as the Solution type.

Select the Workspace, Cluster, and Project you want to use, then click **Next**.

=== Define Version Control

In this step you will set two items:

* NKS: The Remote URL
* Bitbucket: The Private Deploy Key

**Remote URL**

To get this URL, visit your project's Bitbucket repository page and click the **Clone** link in the upper right-hand corner.

NOTE: You must clone with SSH. If the pop-up says HTTPS, click the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner of the pop-up to switch to SSH.

Click to copy the SSH URL. Paste this in to NKS as the Remote URL.

**Private Deploy Key**

For this step you will need an SSH key pair. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For more information on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[see this article].

Use caution when copying the SSH key. For instructions on how to copy the SSH key, see link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[this article].

* **Mac:** Use `pbcopy`.
* **Linux:** Use `xclip`.
* **Windows:** Use Notepad. If you have https://gitforwindows.org/[Git BASH], use the `clip` command.

Paste the **private** key into the Private Deploy Key field on NKS. You will add the **public** key to BitBucket in the next section.

Click **Next** to continue.

=== Configure Application

Set the application's name, update strategy, and scaling. Click **Next** to continue.

=== Review and Confirm

Review and confirm all your settings. To change a setting, click the Edit button.

When you are sure that everything is correct, click **Create** to create the Solution. This creates your Solution and redirects you to the Application's page.

== Deploy and Update Code

Next, you will add configurations to your Bitbucket repository. To do this, you will give Bitbucket:

* The Deploy Key. This is the **public** key you created.
* The Payload URL (webhook) from NKS.

=== Add the Deploy Key

Go to the Bitbucket page for your repository and click **Settings**.

Click **Access Keys** then click **Add key**. Add the **public** SSH key you created.

=== Add the Webhook

From the Bitbucket **Settings** page, click **Webhooks** then click **Add webhook**.

Return to the NKS application page, where you will find the Payload URL.

Paste this in to the URL field on Bitbucket. Set the events you want to trigger the webhook, then click **Add webhook** to add it.

=== Trigger the Webhook if Necessary

When you add your webhook, Bitbucket gives you a list of choices for events which trigger the webhook. By default, a repository push is the webhook trigger. If this is the case for your webhook, you will need to do a `git push` to trigger the webhook.

== Check Your Application

At this point everything is configured, although it make take a few minutes for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the process on the Solution's **Metrics** tab.

When the deployment is ready, you can view your application by visiting the ingress URL which NKS automatically created for your application.
