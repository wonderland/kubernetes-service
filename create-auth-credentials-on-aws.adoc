= Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials

To create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)], you will either need to create a new set of AWS credentials, or find your existing credential.

== Create a New Set of AWS Credentials

To create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)], you will need to:

1. Create an AWS user.
2. Create a policy which grants full access to:
  * Autoscaling
  * CloudWatch
  * EC2
  * Elastic Load Balancing
  * IAM
  * Route 53
3. Attach this policy to the user.

=== Create an AWS User

To create a user, sign into https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[the AWS Management Console] then click **Services**.

In the **Security, Identity & Compliance** column, click **IAM**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-iam.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Click **Users**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-users.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Click **Add User**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-add-user.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Enter the **User Name** then choose the **Access type.**

If this user will only be used to access the API, SDK, and other development tools, click **Programmatic access.** If this user is for someone who will need to log in to the AWS Management Console, choose **AWS Management Console access**.

Then click **Next: Permissions** to continue.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/select-access-type.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Choose whether to add the user to a group, copy permissions from an existing user, or attach existing policies directly.

Note: Amazon recommends using groups as a "best practice" way to manage user permissions.

If you need to create a new policy, see the next section for our recommended policy details.

If you choose to add the user to a group, you can either create a new group or select an existing group.

Then click **Next: Review** to continue.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/create-group.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Confirm the new user's information, then click **Create user** to create the user.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/confirm-user.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Click **Download .csv** and save the user's security credentials to your computer.

Then click **Close** to return to the **Users** page.

=== Create an AWS Policy

When creating a new AWS policy, you will need to allow your user full access to the following services:

* Autoscaling
* CloudWatch
* EC2
* Elastic Load Balancing
* IAM
* Route 53

For an easy way to create a single policy to grant all the necessary access, click **Policies**. You can also access this page from the user account creation process by selecting **Attach existing policies directly > Create policy**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/attach-existing-policy.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Click **Create Policy**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-create-policy.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Click to select **Create Your Own Policy**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/create-your-own-policy.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

Fill out the **Policy Name** field with a name you will be able to identify, like `StackPointCloudPolicy`.

Note that you can only use alphanumeric characters plus a few other characters like `-` and `+`. You cannot use spaces in the policy name.

Copy the following and paste it into the **Policy Document** field:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "ec2:*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "cloudwatch:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "autoscaling:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/attach-policy.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials]

The user account is now ready to be used to create a cluster from https://nks.netapp.io[the NKS website]. The user's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are in the `credentials.csv` file which you downloaded when you created the user.


== Find Your Existing AWS Credentials

To create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You can find these in the `credentials.csv` file which you downloaded when you created the user.

You can only view or download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key when you create the user or the user's access key. However, you can create new access keys at any time.

=== Create a New AWS Access Key

If you no longer have the `credentials.csv` file which you downloaded when you created the AWS user, you can create a new access key at any time.

Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Management Console]. In the **Find Services** section, search for `IAM`. Click the search result for `IAM: Manage User Access and Encryption Keys`.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/aws-auth-key-01-search-iam.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ]

Click **Users**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/aws-auth-key-02-click-users.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ]

Click the user whose credentials you need to access.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/aws-auth-key-03-click-user.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ]

Click the **Security credentials** tab.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/aws-auth-key-04-security-credentials.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ]

If the user has an active access key, delete it. Click **Create access key** to create a new access key.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/aws-auth-key-05-create-access-key.png?raw=true[Add Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ]

At the prompt, download the `credentials.csv` file. You can also copy and paste the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from this pop-up window. Be sure to save `credentials.csv` in a safe place.
