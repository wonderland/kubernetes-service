NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS) is a universal control plane for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters. If you don't already have an NKS account, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

== Getting Started

Welcome to NKS! Read through our series of Getting Started articles for an overview of the process, and learn how to start off right by setting up your NKS account.

* link:getting-started-working-with-clusters.html[Working with NKS Kubernetes Clusters]

== Add Credentials

Provider credentials are the authorization keys for your account on AWS, NetApp HCI, Azure, and other supported providers. This lets you create clusters on the supported provider of your choice.

Get step-by-step instructions for adding provider credentials for:

* link:create-auth-credentials-on-gke.html[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials]

== Create a Kubernetes Cluster

Now that you have set up your NKS account, it's time to launch a Kubernetes cluster with our famously easy, "three clicks and done" process.

Learn how to create a cluster at the provider of your choice with our handy guides:

* link:create-eks-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Amazon EKS]
* link:create-azure-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Azure]
* link:create-anf-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster with Azure NetApp Files (ANF)]s
* link:create-aks-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Microsoft AKS]
* link:create-gce-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Compute Engine (GCE)]
* link:create-gke-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]
* link:create-netapp-hci-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on NetApp HCI Cluster]
* link:create-vmware-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on VMware]

== Manage Access

Learn how to use NKS Teams and Workspaces to manage access for your users. NKS lets you set up multiple levels of access, so that you can restrict authorization keys to certain groups of users, prevent users from one group from creating or deleting clusters in another group's Workspace, and more.

* link:add-a-team.html[Add a Team]
* link:add-a-workspace.html[Add a Workspace]
* link:ssh-to-a-node-in-an-nks-cluster.html[SSH to a Node in an NKS Cluster]

== Cluster Lifecycle

You have set up your NKS account, and launched one or more Kubernetes clusters. Now what? Learn more about how to use and extend NKS, and how to automate your NKS workflow with our new Terraform provider.

== Application Lifecycle Management

Application Lifecycle Management provides a developer-friendly `git push` workflow which lets you deploy your application to an NKS Kubernetes cluster with a simple `git push nks master`. Apps can be deployed with monitoring and more.

Explore Application Lifecycle Management in our series of guides and step-by-step instructional articles:

* link:alm-packages.html[Packages]

== NetApp HCI

Get started with NetApp HCI on NKS by reading our guides on the following topics:

* link:netapp-hci-requirements.html[NetApp HCI Requirements]
* link:hci-enable-nks-for-netapp-hci.html[Enable NKS for NetApp HCI]
* link:create-netapp-hci-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on NetApp HCI]

== Istio

Use Istio to create a service mesh with your NKS Kubernetes clusters.

* link:create-an-istio-mesh.html[Create an Istio Mesh]

== API

Interested in doing things programmatically instead of clicking through a UI? Check out our API. We provide full access to the NKS services through the API. Anything you can do in the UI, you can do through the API as well.
