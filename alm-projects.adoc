= Application Lifecycle Management: Projects

Projects are the top level of Application Lifecycle Management. Projects are created in your desired Workspace, and can contain any combination of Applications, Trackers, and Packages.

NOTE: Application Lifecycle Management is currently in Functional Preview mode. To enable this feature you will need to create a new cluster, and "Enable experimental features."
